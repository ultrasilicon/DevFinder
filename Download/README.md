###Introduction:
<p>In finder, you may have tried to view the hidden files. Then you found a long command to type into the Terminal.</p>
<p>This is the software to realize this function by One Click.</p>
<p>Not only can it show the hidden files, but also the full path on the title bar.</p>
###Main Functions:
· show hidden files
· show full path

##Problem:
This is a advanced version of ’ShowHiddenFile’ I wrote before.
If you have more function that you think I should add for a better experience on Finder, feel free to contact me
